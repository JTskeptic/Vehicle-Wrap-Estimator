Vehicle Wrap Estimator

This is a simple web app to determine an estimated cost for a vehicle wrap. I work for a vehicle wrap shop and a lot of my time is spent estimating wraps for potential clients and businesses with fleet vehicles. This app takes the info I normally take, and does what I normally do with that info to determine a dollar amount. 

This is still very raw, without much pizazz at all. It does the basic functions needed for the job, however I would like to update a few things on it. One thing would be to have a drop-down for the "inches" input to toggle between inches and feet. 

I am also not sure if I've written the JavaScript on this properly or at least the best way. The entire script is a single function, and I know I probably shouldn't be calling the function through the HTML, as that is a dated practive I'm told. However, I am very new to programming and this code works so I haven't messed with it yet.
